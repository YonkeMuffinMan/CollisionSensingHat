# Collision Sensor
## Purpose
The Collision Sensor utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance to objects in its path and warn the user when objects are getting close. The warnings come in the form of LED lights that indicate how close the object is, a vibration motor that increases motor vibration intensity as objects get closer, and an LCD screen that prints the measured distance.
